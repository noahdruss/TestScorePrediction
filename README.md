# TestScorePrediction

***Data Mining Project***

**Purpose:** The purpose of this project is to see how accurately a SciKitLearn linear regression model can predict student test scores based on factors such as gender, race, parental level of education, and whether a student took a test prep course. The Basic Visualizations.ipynb file contains data visualization and the Test Score Regression.ipynb contains data analysis and results.

**Tools used:** SciKitLearn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook

**Results:** The R^2 scores (how close the model's prediction is to the result) were .209, .129, and .230 for math, reading, and writing respectively. Some possible reasons for these scores being on the low side could be not enough data present to predict scores accurately and the fact that humans are hard to predict.

If you would like to run this on your machine you will need jupyter notebook installed. [Here is a link to instructions for running jupyter notebook locally.](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
